# Meta - Build PlUES Tools

This repository contains a collection of scripts to build all the relevant
tools of the PlUES project.

The file `release_config.sh` contains the information used to configure the the
next release and the next development version of each tool.

**NOTE:**  Make sure `release_config.sh` is up to date before starting the
release process.

Once all releases are completed `dist.sh` can be used to create distribution
versions of all tools.
